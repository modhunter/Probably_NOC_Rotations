- Toggle button for automatic aspect switching while moving, standing still, or in combat
- Toggle button for turning on/off automatic misdirect

- Pause rotation when in feign death
- Delayed interrupting: Don't attempt to interrupt until the spellcast is 30% complete
- Toggle to allow for automatic arcane shot on your current mouseover target whenever that target doesn't already have the serpent sting DOT/debuff.  This is a great way to 'DOT-up' multiple enemies that are spread around
